> [!WARNING]
> Due to [Spotify API changes in February 2026](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/february-2026-migration-guide), **Spotify Premium is now required** to use this extension. Starting from February 11, 2026, Spotify requires Premium for app owners using Development Mode. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **Live lyrics sync** with your Spotify playback.
- 🎨 Lyrics colors auto-themed from album cover (via `colorthief`).
- 🖥️ Smooth **side panel view** – code on the left, lyrics on the right.
- 🖱️ **Click-to-seek** – click on any lyric line to jump to that moment in the track (like Spotify app).
- 📱 **Mobile mode** – black unplayed lines, white played lines (like Spotify mobile app).
- 🔑 Simple **one-time login** using your own Spotify Client ID.
- 🚪 Quick logout command to reset session.
- ⚡ Set a **maximum tracks cache size** for lyrics syncing.

## 🔑 Authentication (one-time setup)

2. Create an app → copy **Client ID**.
3. **Important:** set the **Redirect URI** for your app to: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` (default: `8000`).  
   You can change the port in settings (`spotilyrics.port`) or via the command `Set Spotify OAuth Callback Port`.
4. Run the `Show Spotify Lyrics via Spotilyrics` command.
5. Paste your **Client ID** in the panel and log in.
